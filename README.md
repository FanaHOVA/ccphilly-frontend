## CoffeeCodePhilly

> *Coffee is a developer best friend.*

The API is built with Rails 5 (check it out [here](https://github.com/CoffeeCodePhilly/ccphilly)) while the frontend is powered by Ember.js. The code was written a while ago, so it doesn't follow the Ember 2.0 best practices (i.e. no controllers / all components) but a refactoring is on the road map. 

The frontend doesn't have any city-related setting so it's 100% plug and play with your own version of the API.

Feel free to get in touch (fana@alessiofanelli.com) with any questions!
