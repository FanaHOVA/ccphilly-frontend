<p>Finding good coffees to work from can be hard. When I moved to Philly it took me a while to find good spots to work from since all the online reviews websites only take into account the food quality and not wifi speed, number of outlets or the volume of the music. <br> CoffeeCode* tries to fix this by providing infos on how fast the internet is, if the firewall blocks the connection to npm and similar stuff so that you can just focus on doing work.<br><br>

The website is powered by Rails 5 + Ember.js and 100% of the code has been written from coffee shops in Philadelphia! You can reach me at fana@alessiofanelli.com with questions, feature requests and my favorite: job openings!</p>
